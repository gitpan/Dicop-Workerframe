=item * 

The parallel interface does not yet work for extracting passwords -
this needs to be fixed in pwdgen_extract().

=item *

Turning the clock 10 minutes forward will report a wrong "took" time to the
server (resulting in a speed penalty for the client).
Also clock jumping ahead so far that the timeout is triggered is handled as
normal timeout, once again resulting in speed penalty.

Unlcear whether this needs fixing at all.

The clock going backwards is correctly compensated for, though. 

=item *

Currently the workerframe (and client/server) support only one password per
chunk. If one password matches (is found), then the worker stops and reports
this password. In most cases, this is not a problem, however.

=item *

Likewise, the framework does not allow the code to transport any info back
to the client (and hence to the server) except the passwort itself
and potential error messages.
