Please note that the API has changed slightly, you must adapt your code!

Instead of C<< pws->pwd >> and C<< pwd->length >>, use
C<< pwd->cur->content >> and C<< pwd->cur->bytes >> to access the current
password. See C<< doc/I18N.pod >> for more details.

=item added

=item fixed

	Fixed a lot of compiler warnings, and made the compiler options
