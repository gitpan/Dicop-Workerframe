=item *

Support for UniCode and multi-byte characters in general password generator.

This needs a full-blown Unicode support, for converting from ASCII to utf8,
utf16, and vice versa. Along with checking/validating etc. Ugh.

=item *

Pwdgen: check that C<start> is actually smaller than C<end> for SIMPLE and
GROUPED character sets.

=item *

OS independend file access, the "/" vs. "\" trickery is a hack. *sigh* It's
C and we can't just use File::Spec...

=head2 Extraction code

=over 2

=item *

Maybe padd extracted strings to multiples of 4 bytes for speed.

=item *

index sort (sort indices instead of strings) for speed? Similiar,
implement shellsort (see Sedgewick) for speed?

=item *

could limit it's memory usage better (use more available memory).

=item *

does not yet handle a timeout (make and re-use a global sub for this)

=item *

could use gzip to support gzipped images.
