Support for Unicode and multi-byte characters in password generator:

  * add support for UTF-16 to the string extractor
  * finish the extract parameter setup (extract_utf8, extract_utf16 etc)
  * pwdgen_add_bom(pwd, string)
  * add support for surrogate pairs in UTF-16
  * add support for little/big endian UTF-16 (including BOM)
  * finish the encoding conversions for multi-byte encodings

=item *

Pwdgen: check that C<start> is actually smaller than C<end> for SIMPLE and
GROUPED character sets.

=item *

OS independent file access, the "/" vs. "\" trickery is a hack. *sigh* It's
C and we can't just use File::Spec...

Maybe padd extracted strings to multiples of 4 bytes for speed.

=item *

index sort (sort indices instead of strings) for speed? Similar,
implement shellsort (see Sedgewick) for speed?
